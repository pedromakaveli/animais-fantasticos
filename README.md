## About the project

This project was created in the front-end course at Origamid. In this project, I put into practice what I learned during the course, such as adding and removing classes, loops in array objects, scope of functions and events using JavaScript.

## How to see the project

1. First you need git installed
2. Copy the Url: `https://github.com/pedromakaveli/animais-fantasticos.git`
3. With git bash, type:
```
git clone https://github.com/pedromakaveli/animais-fantasticos.git
```

Now you can see the project and edit

## Thanks!
